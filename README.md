# Templated C++ Algorithms and Data Structures

## About this repo

  This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures written in C++.

  I came across most of these algorithms and data structures during my years of Computer Science and programming studies at university, so I believe many students might find that repository useful.

  For now, it is structured in a monolithic way. I am working to break the code into smaller pieces, to improve readability and overall handling of the codebase. 

  My wish is for everyting implemented in here to be Templated and sufficiently documented in a way that you can just copy/import and use it.


## For general public

  If you are looking for some data structure or algorithm that is implemented in here, feel free to read, redistribute, clone and use it for personal purposes. 

  If perhaps you want to contribute with some piece of code or suggestion, go ahead, although I don't give you garantees that I will be revising any of it (But I would enjoy and PROBLABLY do it)


## For Students

  If you're a student of some sort, please don't copy, submit or claim authorship for any of these algorithms for your essays, graded homeworks or to do's related to your college institution, as it surelly configures a infraction of your institution's ethics guidelines. You should read the code, understand it and implement it yourself based in your own understanding of the logic and implementation, and further study material you might have.
